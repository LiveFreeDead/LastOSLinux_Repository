It's a small piece of software that runs in the background to help protect your computer from malware (malicious software) like viruses, spyware, and other potentially unwanted software. Some spyware protection is better than none, and it's built in and free! But... if you are already running something that provides great anti-malware protection, Defender will probably be wasting precious resources and there is no need to have more than one application running at a time.The problem with all Defender versions in Windows Vista and above is that it's integrated into the operating system and installs by default with no visible or hidden option to uninstall. Many people are looking for ways to disable or remove it from their system as they prefer to use other software. And for example, on Windows 8 and 10 you cannot turn Windows Defender completely off anymore. A click on Settings in Windows Defender opens the control panel for the program in the new Windows Settings application. You can turn the program's real-time protection off temporarily, but when it has been off for a while Windows will turn it back on automatically. It is unclear why Microsoft made the decision to change the behavior of Windows Defender in this regard. What is certain, however, is that it will annoy users who want to disable it permanently on the computer they are working on. Defender Control is a small, portable freeware which will allow you to disable Windows Defender in Windows 10 completely.Defender Control has CMD (command line) support:/E - Enable Windows Defender/D - Disable Windows Defender/Q - Queries Windows Defender status (0=Defender is running; 1=Defender is turned off; 2=Defender Real-Time Protection is disabled; 3=Defender service is not available in the system),|,https://www.sordum.org,|,5,|,%ppApps%/Defender.Control,|,%URLPath%/Defender.Control_v2.1_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/Defender.Control_v2.1_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/defendercontrolppapp.png,|,423,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/defendercontrolppapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/defendercontrolppapp.png,|,,|,keepall,|,System|Security|Tweak,|,Sordum.org,|,,|,4,|,,|,,|,2,|,2.1,|,2022-03-01,|,,|,,|,762840,|,Defender Control,|,Defender Control is a small, portable freeware which will allow you to disable Windows Defender in Windows 10 completely.,|,,|,System Process; System Task; Security;,|,%ppApps%/Defender.Control,|,dControl.exe,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,Explorer,|,winget,|,x86 + x64,|,defendercontrolppapp,|,,|,

Unlike Windows search, Everything initially displays every file and folder on your computer (hence the name "Everything"). You type in a search filter to limit what files and folders are displayed.How long will it take to index my files?"Everything" only indexes file and folder names and generally takes a few seconds to build its database. A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will take about 1 second to index. 1,000,000 files will take about 1 minute.Does Everything search file contents?Yes, "Everything" can search file content with the content: search function. File content is not indexed, searching content is slow.Does "Everything" hog my system resources?No, "Everything" uses very little system resources. A fresh install of Windows 10 (about 120,000 files) will use about 14 MB of ram and less than 9 MB of disk space. 1,000,000 files will use about 75 MB of ram and 45 MB of disk space.Does "Everything" monitor file system changes?Yes, "Everything" does monitor your file systems for all changes. Your search results will update in real-time to reflect any changes. Everything will automatically keep your NTFS indexes up to date with the NTFS USN Journal. Changes will not be missed when Everything is not running as the system maintains the NTFS USN Journal.[ppApp note: Registry entries included that make Everything run as Administrator.],|,http://www.voidtools.com,|,5,|,%ppApps%/Everything,|,%URLPath%/Everything.(Search)_v1.4.1.1028_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/Everything.(Search)_v1.4.1.1028_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/everything(search)ppapp.png,|,459,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/everything(search)ppapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/everything(search)ppapp.png,|,,|,keepall,|,Directory|Disk,|,voidtools,|,,|,0,|,,|,,|,2,|,1.4.1.1028,|,2025-06-20,|,,|,,|,6294553,|,Everything (Search) {#1},|,Search for 'everything' on your PC.

HashTab supports many hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA1, SHA2, RipeMD, HAVAL and Whirlpool. Hashtab is supported as a Windows shell extension. HashTab provides an easy way to verify file integrity and authenticity.Once you have installed HashTab, just right click on any file. On Windows, select Properties and you will see a new "File Hashes" tab. On Mac select "File Hashes" (on 10.5 the "File Hashes" menu item will be found under the "More" submenu).  "File Hashes" displays all the configured hashes for the file. You can customize which hashes are calculated and displayed. You can hash other files for comparison. You can also paste in hash text so you don't go cross-eyed trying to compare hashes.  HashTab supports the following hash functions: Adler32, CRC32, MD2, MD4, MD5, RIPEMD(128,256,320), SHA-1,256,384,512, Tiger, and Whirlpool.  Coming soon, MD6, eDonkey/eMule.What's new in HashTab 4.0?* You can now enter a hash to compare while the hash is running.  This is handy for verifying large download files.* When hashing completes, HashTab will now scan the clipboard to search for matching hash values.  This means you can just copy a hash value from a web page and as long as it is still on the clipboard, HashTab will find it automatically and show the match.* Updated to the latest release of CryptoPP.* 64-bit install now includes the 32-bit DLL as well for people that run 32-bit file managers instead of Windows explorer.  HashTab will "just work" with these custom configurations.* Languages are now included as separate satellite DLLs.  By default, HashTab will use the system language. You can change this in the registry HKCU\Software\Hashtab\Settings\LanguageModule set it to the name of the module you want to use such as "Resource.English.dll".  There is currently no UI for this, but this may be useful for people creating custom images that include HashTab.* HashTab has been rebranded for Implbits software and the license has been updated.  Don't worry, its still free for personal private use.

The entire file system can be quickly sorted by name, size or date. WizFile currently only supports NTFS formatted hard drives but support for other hard drive types is planned.What makes WizFile so fast?When scanning NTFS formatted hard drives (most modern hard drives use this format), WizFile reads the hard drive's Master File Table (MFT) directly from the disk. The MFT is a special hidden file used by the NTFS file system to keep track of all files and folders on a hard drive. Scanning for files this way completely bypasses the operating system (Windows) and provides a huge performance boost.Features:- Find files by name on your hard drives almost instantly- VERY Fast scanning! WizFile reads the master file table (MFT) directly from NTFS formatted hard drives so it's ready for use very quickly after start up.- Search by file name or full path name- Multiple search terms supported- Wild card file search (* and ? wild cards supported)- Monitors for file changes while active - your visible file search results will always be up to date- Keeps track of folder sizes - any changes made to the file system will automatically update the folder sizes- Does not require a separate database file - all file data is kept in memoryHow to Search:Just start typing and search results will appear. While WizFile is active is will monitor your hard drives for file changes. Any changes that affect the current search results will update on screen as they occur.Wildcards:Use a * (asterisk) to match and one or more characters. Use a ? (question mark) to match any single character. For example, to search for all files that start with the letters "da", type in:da*To find all files starting with the letter a with "d" as the 3rd letter, type in:a?d*To file all files with a particular extension, e.g. all mp3 files:*.mp3Multiple Search Items (AND/OR):Separate multiple search terms with a space. The space acts like an "AND" operator. For example to seach for files of type ".mp3" that also contain the word "dance", type in:*.mp3 danceIf your search term has a space in it use double quotes around it, e.g.:*.mp3 "dance hits"Use the vertical pipe (|) symbol as an "OR" operator for multiple search items. E.g. to find all .mp3 and .wav files:*.mp3|*.wavTo find all .mp3 and .wav files that contain the word "dance":*.mp3|*.wav danceMatch File Name Only:If this option is selected the search will only be applied to the file name (the path is not searched)Match Entire Path:If this option is selected the search will be applied to the entire path. If the search term contains a "\" (backslash) then the search will be performed on the entire path regardless of the current "match" setting. This is slower than a file name only search.,|,https://antibody-software.com/web/software/software/wizfile-finds-your-files-fast/,|,5,|,%ppApps%/WizFile,|,%URLPath%/WizFile_v3.10_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/WizFile_v3.10_x64+x86_ppApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/wizfileppapp.png,|,509,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/wizfileppapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/wizfileppapp.png,|,,|,keepall,|,File Utility|Directory|Disk,|,Antibody Software,|,,|,5,|,,|,,|,2,|,3.10,|,2024-05-22,|,,|,,|,20623187,|,WizFile {#1},|,Analyzes and visualizes disk-space usage and lets you manage it.,|,,|,Disk Directory; File Utility;,|,%ppApps%/WizFile,|,_x86/WizFile.exe,|,,|,Is_x86,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,All,|,All,|,x86 + x64,|,wizfileppapp,|,,|,

They find out that their beautiful home has been turned into a horrid place by The Wicked One, a dark and cunning Tiny with a giant fang jutting from its mouth. The player controls a Tiny, who must defeat The Wicked One, who has captured the king and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters by using a device simply referred to as "the machine".The player guides a small furry, bouncy and fragile Tiny across eight regions of the land, Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle where one must defeat the Wicked One. The regions each have unique music, color schemes and styles. Each has 10 separate levels and a collection of secret bonus levels. The final stage of the game has the player entering the machine (which turns out to be a large industrial complex) and destroying it. Along the way the player must avoid various perils, such as monsters, spikes and acid.The game's primary unique feature is Tiny's ability to transform itself into four different forms: yellow, green, red and blue. Different skills are required at different points, and not all forms are available in all levels. Particularly in levels which are primarily puzzlers, the player may encounter fields which activate and deactivate certain powers.In its yellow form, it controls the element of fire, allowing it to shoot fireballs. In its red form, it controls the element of earth, allowing it to eat through some elements of the scenery. In its green form, it controls the element of air, allowing it to produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.* Note: When you first run this it will download the flatpak version of DosBox Staging.

It's been designed from the ground up to work automatically in your home network with a variety of devices like an LG 2011 Netcast TV, Plex Client for Mac OS X, or numerous Mobile Devices like your iPhone, iPad or Android device.* What Does the Plex Media Server do?It's easy to watch movie files on a computer monitor. But, what happens when your collection starts to get large? How do you find the show you want to watch easily? How do you know you've watched an episode, or where you stopped it last night? How do you share the media files over several screens? What about content from the Internet?The Plex Media Server solves these problems by gathering information about your media and storing it on a single Mac or Windows PC Server. Connect one or more of the many Plex clients available and your media is instantly available on any of them. The Plex Media Server learns what each movie file actually is and then visits Movie and TV Show websites. It gathers information like plot summaries, posters – even TV Show theme music. This metadata is displayed in the Plex Client so choosing the show to watch a rich and exciting experience. The Plex Media Server also supports plug-ins that let you watch content from the Internet as easily as other media.* Streaming SupportCentral to the Plex Media Server is a powerful and cleverly designed transcoding engine. This supports a rich variety of mobile devices, low cost platforms and other possibilities.* What is Transcoding?Transcoding is the process of converting a media file from one resolution or compression format to another. For example, you might transcode a full 1080p to 720p, or from VC-1 encoding to H.264. The original file is read, then re-saved in the new resolution and codec, possibly in a different file container.* Why is transcoding useful in Plex?Plex Media Server can 'stream' media files to various Plex clients. Some run on powerful computers like Plex for Mac OS X whilst others run on low powered mobile handsets. Some support full 1080p resolutions while others have smaller low resolution screens. Most of the mobile platforms connect over Wifi or 3G networks where streaming full resolution media would choke the network. All in all, it's extremely difficult to play full resolution media on mobile platforms.The solution is to transcode the media to a version optimized specifically for the device playing it. Plex Media Server transcodes media on-the-fly and streams the optimized version to the device. This way, a low resolution device is able to play high resolution media smoothly and over it's wireless network constraints.Even better, transcoding means that a mobile device can handle a huge range of media file formats, codecs and resolutions. The transcoding process means that the client only ever receives a single format or codec. This is important as many mobile devices have hardware decoders that only handle a single codec. For you, it means that as long as the Plex Media Server supports the codec, so will your mobile device, thanks to transcoding.* Direct Stream and Direct PlayTranscoding media is important for smaller devices like a mobile phone or tablet. There is another class of device that are low-cost but extremely capable players - like the AppleTV. These devices can generally play higher resolution files, but work best with particular codecs. So, if you have a high resolution media fie encoded with the wrong codec, the file will need to be transcoded with the correct codec. The Plex Media Server handles these situations with smart transcoding, Direct Play and Direct Stream.* Direct PlayDuring the media analysis phase, the Plex Media Server looks at certain attributes of your media (resolution, bitrate, etc.). When a client requests a piece of media, the server looks at the client’s capabilities, compares them to the media parameters, and makes a determination as to whether or not the file can be directly played on the device. For example, if you have a properly prepared MP4 file, it’ll play without any transcoding on an iOS device. Tiny CPU usage, and no loss in quality. If you had a movie in MKV format and also encoded it for mobile devices (and both versions scanned into your library), the media server is smart enough to mark the specific version of the file as playable by the device.* Direct StreamingMost of these devices support hardware decoding of the H.264 codec, but may not support a particular file format. When a client connects to the Plex Media Server, it describes its capabilities, and if the file falls within the acceptable range, the video is simply copied over to a compatible format (a process known as re-muxing). This again means that there is very little CPU used on the server side, and no loss in quality in the video. Streams start up nearly instantly, and seek quickly.* Smart TranscodingTranscoding is handled smartly. If you have a media file that is partly compatible with the Client - maybe the video portion is correct but the audio is not - the process is smart enough to only transcode what's necessary and stream that to the client.To move the database open command prompt:mklink /D "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server" "D:\Plex Media Server\Plex Media Server",|,http://www.plexapp.com,|,5,|,$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Plex/Plex Media Server,|,%URLPath%/Plex.Media.Server_v1.41.4.9463_x64_ssApp.apz,|,%DBPath%/Plex.Media.Server_v1.41.4.9463_x64_ssApp.apz,|,,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexmediaserverssapp.png,|,602,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexmediaserverssapp.jpg,|,%DBPath%/.lldb/plexmediaserverssapp.png,|,,|,keepall,|,Streaming|Channel|Server|Library|Video,|,Plex,|,,|,5,|,,|,,|,2,|,1.41.4.9463,|,2025-02-22,|,,|,Glenn,|,187067430,|,Plex Media Server,|,The solution for your local and online media,|,,|,Video;,|,$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Plex/Plex Media Server,|,Plex Media Server.exe,|,,|,,|,,|,F,|,F,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,,|,False,|,,|,Explorer,|,winget,|,x64,|,plexmediaserverssapp,|,,|,

The dockers and panels can be moved and customized for your specific workflow. Once you have your setup, you can save it as your own workspace. You can also create your own shortcuts for commonly used tools.Beautiful Brushes:Over 100 professionally made brushes that come preloaded. These brushes give a good range of effects so you can see the variety of brushes that Krita has to offer.Brush Stabilizers:Have a shaky hand? Add a stabilizer to your brush to smoothen it out. Krita includes 3 different ways to smooth and stabilize your brush strokes. There is even a dedicated Dynamic Brush tool where you can add drag and mass.Vector & Text:Built-in vector tools help you create comic panels. Select a word bubble template from the vector library and drag it on your canvas. Change the anchor points to create your own shapes and libraries. Add text to your artwork as well with the text tool. Krita uses SVG to manage its vector format.Brush Engines:Customize your brushes with over 9 unique brush engines. Each engine has a large amount of settings to customize your brush. Each brush engine is made to satisfy a specific need such as the Color Smudge engine, Shape engine, Particle engine, and even a filter engine. Once you are done creating your brushes, you can save them and organize them with Krita's unique tagging system.Wrap-around mode:It is easy to create seamless textures and patterns now. The image will make references of itself along the x and y axis. Continue painting and watch all of the references update instantly. No more clunky offsetting to see how your image repeats itself.Resource Manager:Import brush and texture packs from other artists to expand your tool set. If you create some brushes that you love, share them with the world by creating your own bundles. Check out the brush packs that are available in the Resources area.Simple and Powerful 2D Animation:Turn Krita into an animation studio by switching to the animation workspace. Bring your drawings to life by layering your animations, importing audio, and fine tuning your frames. When you are finished, share with your friends by exporting your creation to a video.
